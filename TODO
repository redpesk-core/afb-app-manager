The current status of the framework evolves
The need is to:

- split the RPM plugin in 2 parts:
  * the part remaining as RPM plugin:
    + browses the list of files
    + establishes rednode properties (prefixes ...)
    + contact the second and trusted part to install the files
  * the part extracted is the installer
    + scans the installed files
    + checks the security (permission, signatures, ...)
    + deduce the security rules
    + installs the files (using security-manager)
    + setup the launchers

- afm-system-daemon becomes a client of the installer daemon described above

- the configuration file must be changed to allow installation of plugins and extensions

- the sharing has to be taken into account in security

- drop of xmlsec!
